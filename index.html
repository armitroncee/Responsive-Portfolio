          <img class="auth-image" src="assets/images/profilepic.jpg" alt="Profile Pic" />
          <p> My name is Christopher Rogers. I was born in California and moved to Denver, Colorado when I was 12. Growing up in a basketball state, I grew to love the sport of basketball. I use to play and watch basketball all day. Being a fan of the sport, It has made me a very competitive person so I would always try to be better and practice as much as I can to be better at all that I do. </p>
          <p> Aside from basketball, I also love to play video games and watch movies. I like to escape life and live out fantasies in video games. You can be anything you want in a video game. Movies have also been a passion of mine. I used to want to be in the movies. I enjoy how movies make you feel. They can make you feel happy or sad and when I'm down it can pick up my mood.</p>
